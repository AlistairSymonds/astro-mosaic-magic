# astro-mosaic-magic

Designed to make it really easy to make mosaics from raw calibrated sub exposures.

Alternatively it can be used purely as a platesolving image registration software, with integration happening in other programs.

Loosely based on what I learnt from writing a flatteneing tool for arbitrarily large mosaics of non-linear images for /r/astrophotography's project patchwork https://github.com/AlistairSymonds/astro-project-patchwork

## Setup

conda create -n astro -c astropy astropy reproject shapely matplotlib


## Usage
